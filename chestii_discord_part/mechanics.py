                          "**Damage x Crit Damage x Crit Damage = Devastation Damage**.\n" \
                          "Devastation Chance is based on your Crit Chance above 100% and your Devastation stat. " \
                          "For example, if you have 150% Crit Chance and level 2.5k Devastation, you will " \
                          "devastate 12.5% of the time (50% x 0.25). You need at least 200% Crit Chance to always " \

walls_title = "Which wall should I equip? / Do the wall effects stack?"
walls_description = "Which wall you equip is just a cosmetic choice, because all wall effects are passive, and stack " \
                    "additively. For example, that means if you buy the two +25% elixir walls, you'll have 50% more " \
                    "elixir regardless of which wall you have equipped, even if it's a gold or damage wall. "

quickstart_title = "What is Quickstart? When should I get it?"
quickstart_description = "Quickstart is an unlockable feature that you can buy when starting any Expedition run that " \
                         "costs 600 Rubies, which allows you to start Expedition (Easy/Normal/Hard/Hell) from a later " \
                         "point than 00:00. For example, if your personal best in Hell is 16:00, Quickstart will let " \
                         "you start Hell from 10:00. This speeds up the bones/hour that you get from Expedition." \
                         "\nBecause of other priorities to spend your rubies on, we generally recommend buying " \
                         "Quickstart if you have progressed past 20:00 in Hell. You can also buy it earlier if you " \

                        "This is the best strategy for Nightmare all the way to Day 12k. You'll need the legendary " \

                        "Esther, Elaine and DM, Luna, Hank, hopefully all at 10*. If your Galatine is too old " \

                        "For Hell, you want to die as soon as you can't kill mobs anymore, you can achieve that by replacing " \

nmtime_title = "What is Nightmare start time based on?"
nmtime_description = "Your starting time in Nightmare is based on your max Day in Campaign. Because of this, you " \
                     "should generally do your Nightmare runs for the day before you push. This changes once you can " \

                   " your heroes will slowly push towards it, but won't go above it. Once they get there, or if you " \
                   "closed the game already at max Day, they will also farm Idle/Passive Rewinds and Gold, once every " \
                   "60 or 45 minutes depending on your Idle Speed skill.\n\nIdle/Passive Rewinds will increase your " \
                   "Rewind Perks (-wave, portal chance, rewind speed, gilded portal chance), but won't generate any E" \
                   "lixir or Tickets, and are much slower than rewinding actively. Because of this, Idle isn't a very " \
                   "used mechanic, especially by higher day players."

howtobeat_title = "How do I beat this mob/boss?"
howtobeat_description = "In general, the answer to this question is always deal more damage, usually by rewinding more " \
                        "and upgrading your skills. Some mobs and bosses do have certain tricks to them though.\n\n" \
                        "Some mobs have resistances, so they can't be damaged by %current hp (purple damage), such as " \
                        "Warmongers and all mobs in Cyber; or %max hp (red/black damage), such as Sentinels, Banshees " \

                        "Most/all Campaign bosses can be killed with just %hp damage, but that requires specific " \

afkassist_description = "AFK Assist is the most expensive and most impactful pack. It allows your Defender (the guy " \
                        "with the weapon) to aim by himself, without the need for you to keep your finger on the screen" \

                        "purchase, which is very worth it during gear farming at Day 10000, since Scrolls are hard to " \
                        "come by and the more you have, the less time you have to spend farming. You still shouldn't " \

                        "he rest of the purchases are very underwhelming and give very little value for what they cost," \
